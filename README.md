🚖 Uber Fare Prediction System

Machine Learning | Streamlit Web App | Python

📌 Project Overview
The Uber Fare Prediction System is a machine-learning-based web application that estimates the fare for an Uber ride based on user inputs such as distance, number of passengers, and time-related features.
The project demonstrates the complete ML pipeline — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment using Streamlit.

This project showcases practical skills in:
Data preprocessing & feature engineering
Model training & evaluation
Model serialization
Web app deployment
GitHub project documentation

🎯 Features
🔢 User-friendly input form (Distance, Passengers, Date & Time)
🤖 Machine Learning-based fare prediction
💰 Displays estimated fare in Indian Rupees (₹)
🌐 Interactive Streamlit web interface
📦 Clean and modular project structure
